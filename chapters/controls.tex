\chapter{Overview of Controls}
 
Since Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is an ASCII Game (a complex one at that), the control scheme is different from the modern day type of games. You will be required to utilize all of your keyboards' buttons to get every possible action done. Another factor is the capitalization of letters. so [e] is another Button altogether than [E].
 
Movement is done either by using the keyboard's numeric keyPad, with each of the buttons representing one of the 8 directions and [5] being the wait option. There is also the option of using a different control layout using the right side of the keyboard, yet this is probably more difficult to use.
