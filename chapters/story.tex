\chapter{The Story}

The best part of the story? Nobody really knows what's going on (not even the devs). But to give you a quick rundown: You are just another nameless citizen in a near-futuristic (around 2040-ish) New England, a.k.a the USA, when all of a sudden the cataclysm hit and several extra-dimensional beings attack simultaneously. Somehow, you seem to have been spared from the events for the most part and managed to find yourself surviving for the first bit of the aftermath. Now, it's several days after the initial strike and you need to get your ass moving to survive. However, it seems the cataclysm hasn't only brought zombies to the playing field, but otherworldly beings also seem to invade the planet at the same time. This is however not just restricted to one group of beings far beyond our understanding. You are nothing but a microscopic speck trying to survive in a now hostile world, and survive you shall, or not.
